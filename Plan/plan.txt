Detailed Plan for C# API with Clean Architecture, MSSQL, Dapper, Redis, JWT, Roles, Permissions, and Serilog

1. Project Structure:
   - Solution with three main projects:
     a) Core (Domain Layer)
        - Entities: User, Role, Permission, Menu
        - Interfaces: IRepository, IUnitOfWork, ICacheService, IAuthService
        - DTOs and domain services
     b) Infrastructure
        - Data access with Dapper for MSSQL
        - Redis cache implementation for performance optimization
        - Serilog logging configuration for structured and centralized logging
        - JWT authentication implementation with secure token handling
     c) API (Presentation Layer)
        - ASP.NET Core Web API project
        - Controllers for authentication, user management, role and permission management
        - Middleware for JWT authentication and authorization enforcement
        - Dependency injection setup for loose coupling and testability

2. Database:
   - MSSQL database connection string configuration with secure storage
   - Dapper for efficient SQL query execution and object mapping
   - Migrations or SQL scripts for creating tables: Users, Roles, Permissions, UserRoles, RolePermissions, Menus
   - Ensure referential integrity and indexing for performance

3. Caching:
   - Redis cache integration for caching frequently accessed data such as user permissions and menus
   - Cache invalidation strategies to maintain data consistency
   - Configuration of Redis connection and error handling

4. Authentication and Authorization:
   - JWT token generation and validation with expiration and refresh token support
   - User login endpoint to authenticate and issue JWT securely
   - Role-based and permission-based authorization for API endpoints using policies
   - Middleware to enforce authorization policies and handle unauthorized access gracefully

5. Logging:
   - Serilog setup to log to console, file, and optionally external sinks (e.g., Seq, ELK)
   - Structured logging of API requests, responses, errors, and important events
   - Correlation IDs for tracing requests across services

6. Additional:
   - Use appsettings.json for configuration management with environment-specific overrides
   - Implement clean separation of concerns and dependency injection throughout the solution
   - Provide sample seed data for roles, permissions, and default users for initial setup
   - Include comprehensive unit and integration tests for critical components
   - Documentation for setup, running, and testing the API

Follow-up Steps:
- Create solution and projects with appropriate folder structure
- Implement domain entities, DTOs, and interfaces in Core project
- Setup infrastructure services including database access, caching, logging, and authentication
- Develop API controllers, middleware, and configure dependency injection
- Implement unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability
- Test authentication, authorization, caching, and logging functionalities thoroughly
- Provide detailed instructions for running, testing, and deploying the API

This plan ensures a robust, maintainable, and scalable API solution following best practices in Clean Architecture and modern .NET development.
